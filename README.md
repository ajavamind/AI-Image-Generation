# AI-Image-Generation
 Processing Java sketches using Open-AI
 Runs on Windows using the Processing.org SDK version 4.2.
 
 Generate AI created images from a text prompt using OpenAI Dall-E 2 API.
 The sketch application displays the generated image and saves it in the "output" folder.
 
 Sketches use OpenAI-Java API from a Github implementation (version 0.11.0) found at
 
 https://github.com/TheoKanning/openai-java

 In order to use the sketch you need to establish an account with OpenAI.
 In the environment variables for Windows 10/11 create a OPENAI_TOKEN variable with your paid account token.
